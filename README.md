Notes:

- I was under a pretty extreme tiime crunch so there's only 1 page (dashboard).
- This uses the <link>https://open-meteo.com/ weather API. Please only enter a city name in the search (don't incude state or country).
- If a city doesn't work, just try another one. ðŸ˜’
- No CSS libraries were used.
- Light/Dark theme should work.
- Responsive is pretty basic (again, tight deadline).
- Some of the data is just placeholder (login/avatar, other cities, chance of rain, UV index, visibility). Some of this is because the API doesn't have the data and some is because of the time crunch.
